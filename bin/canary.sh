#!/bin/bash
# bin/canary.sh — live capability canary. Probes whether a capability WORKS,
# by performing or adjudicating a real action.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   Unit tests check CODE. bin/doctor.sh checks STATE. Neither checks
#   CAPABILITY. One build produced five capabilities that were green and dead
#   at the same time: board fan-out (1,779 unit tests passing, doctor 0 issues,
#   an anti-affinity APPROVE -- and every fan-out refused before host
#   admission); swarm (six test modules, 1,531 lines, no dispatch path at all);
#   the notification spine (doctor reported it, doctor could not measure it,
#   the reconciler exited 1); anti-affinity review (a 35-test suite that still
#   passed with three `must be cross-family` clauses replaced by `if False:`);
#   and advisory mode (a mode file, a protocol entry, a builder branch, and not
#   one successful dispatch in a month).
#
#   Every one of those is invisible to a test and to a state check, and visible
#   to a live action. That is the entire scope of this program.
#
# THREE OUTCOMES, NEVER TWO
#   PASS          the probe ran and the capability worked
#   FAIL          the probe ran and the capability is broken       (exit 1)
#   NOT MEASURED  the probe did not run, or its oracle is broken   (exit 2)
#
#   NOT MEASURED is never a pass. This mirrors doctor.sh's COULD NOT DETERMINE
#   and bin/test's BLOCKED, and it exists because a probe that returns "fine"
#   when the subsystem is absent is worse than no probe: it manufactures the
#   exact false confidence this program was written to destroy.
#
# EVERY PROBE HAS A POSITIVE CONTROL
#   Before any probe reports PASS or FAIL it first proves its own oracle can
#   see. The memory probe recalls its nonce BEFORE recording it and requires
#   zero hits. The skills probe requires its sentinel to still be present in
#   the skill file. The registry probes require a loadable, populated registry.
#   A control that cannot be established downgrades the probe to NOT MEASURED.
#
# EVERY PROBE HAS AN INVERTED CONTROL
#   `--self-test` breaks each capability against a fixture and asserts the
#   probe FAILS or reports NOT MEASURED. A canary that cannot fail is not a
#   gate; four green-but-broken cases above are what that costs.
#   scripts/python/tests/test_canary_suite.py pins the same inversions.
#
# WHAT A WORKER CANNOT DO
#   A board worker cannot launch a board dispatch, so probes 1-3 and 6 cannot be
#   EXECUTED from a lane. They are split instead: Chrono launches the two
#   role-specific canary packets, and this program ADJUDICATES the evidence
#   those tasks left in the registry, outbox and notify receipts. `--task` and
#   `--mcp-task` may adjudicate both results in one run.
#
# USAGE
#   bin/canary.sh                      probes that run here; 1-3, 6 NOT MEASURED
#   bin/canary.sh --task TASK-ID       adjudicate transport/skills evidence
#   bin/canary.sh --mcp-task TASK-ID   adjudicate Codex MCP evidence (may combine)
#   bin/canary.sh --emit-packet ID     print the transport/skills packet
#   bin/canary.sh --emit-mcp-packet ID print the Codex MCP-surface packet
#   bin/canary.sh --emit-mcp-expectation-example print placeholder local JSON
#   bin/canary.sh --self-test          inverted controls (no live writes)
#   bin/canary.sh --no-memory-write    skip probe 4's one vault note
#
# MCP EXPECTATION (operator-local; never an observed host answer in this file)
#   CANARY_MCP_EXPECTED_JSON takes precedence, even when empty or invalid.
#   Otherwise read CANARY_MCP_EXPECTED_FILE, defaulting to the gitignored
#   <root-under-test>/_state/canary-mcp-expected.json. An external path is allowed.
#   Supply a sorted, unique, non-empty JSON array of runtime namespace prefixes.
#   Generate yours: map the selected role/lane projection to runtime prefixes,
#   sort/deduplicate, and save that JSON locally before measuring the worker.
#   Never derive the expectation from the observed report being adjudicated.
#
# EXIT CODES
#   0  every probe PASS
#   1  at least one FAIL
#   2  no FAIL, but at least one NOT MEASURED   (the default invocation)
#   64 usage error (EX_USAGE, matching doctor.sh)

# Live capability canary

Do exactly three things and nothing else. This packet is deliberately trivial:
it measures the transport, not the work.

1. Run \`git rev-parse --short HEAD\` and paste the literal output.
2. Invoke the project skill named \`probe-canary\` through this worker's runtime
   skill mechanism. Report the literal invocation, the resolved base directory,
   and whether its name resolved bare or required a prefix. Quote, **verbatim**,
   the first prose paragraph after its heading (excluding frontmatter).
   Do not paraphrase it or reconstruct it from memory -- the exact wording is
   the measurement. Use the copy this runtime resolves.
3. Write your response envelope to the return_artifact path above.

If the skill does not resolve, say so and paste the literal error. An absent
skill is a real result; an invented quotation is not.

# Live Codex MCP-surface canary

Do exactly two things and nothing else. This packet measures the MCP surface of
the systems-engineer@gpt-codex board worker.

1. Enumerate the MCP server namespaces exposed by THIS worker's live tool
   inventory. Do not read an adapter or config file, and do not use a child
   \`codex mcp list\`: that starts a different process and reports configuration,
   not this worker's callable surface. If the runtime provides \`ALL_TOOLS\`,
   enumerate names beginning \`mcp__\`, extract the component between the first
   two \`__\` separators, deduplicate, and sort. Otherwise use the runtime's
   equivalent live tool-manifest operation. Also enumerate every complete MCP
   tool name in \`tool_names\`; each namespace must have at least one tool and
   every tool's namespace must be in \`server_prefixes\`. Make one authorized,
   bounded read-only call to every namespace found. Paste
   the literal inventory command/expression and literal output, then emit exactly
   one single-line record with sorted unique arrays (a prefix belongs in
   \`successful_probes\` only after a non-error call):

   \`MCP_SURFACE_JSON: {"inventory_command":"<literal command or expression>","server_prefixes":["<runtime prefix>"],"successful_probes":["<runtime prefix>"],"tool_names":["mcp__<runtime prefix>__<tool>"]}\`

2. Write your response envelope to the return_artifact path above.
