# UserPromptSubmit hook: measure Chrono's own context size and warn when it is large.
#
# Why: on 2026-09-18 the coordinator ran 11 hours to ~768k cached input tokens with no
# compaction and its rules drifted. shared/lifecycle.md rule 8 gives specialist CLIs a
# 60%-of-window circuit breaker; nothing measured Chrono itself. The transcript already
# carries the number: every assistant record has message.usage, and
# cache_read + cache_creation + input is the context that was sent on the last call.
#
# Contract: always exit 0; print either one valid hook JSON object or nothing. A missing
# or unreadable transcript, malformed stdin, or any internal error prints nothing.
#
#   CHRONO_CONTEXT_WARN  default 400000  finish the current step, then handoff + /clear
#   CHRONO_CONTEXT_HARD  default 600000  handoff + /clear this turn, before anything else
#
# Registered in chrono/.claude/settings.json as "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-.}/../bin/...": hooks
# run with cwd = the launch directory (chrono/), so the "." fallback resolves the same path
# and an unset CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR does not surface as a "No such file" hook error.

# The hook JSON arrives on stdin, so the Python source is passed via -c rather than a
# stdin heredoc; a heredoc would replace the hook payload.
