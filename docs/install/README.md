# Install

The supported install path, in order. Each step has a command you run and a
**check** that proves it worked. Do not move to the next step until the check
passes — an installed file is not evidence that a capability works.

Vibe Squad currently targets macOS.

| # | Step | Guide |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Core tools (`tmux`, `fswatch`, `jq`, `curl`, Python, `uv`) | below |
| 2 | The five provider CLIs, installed and authenticated | [provider-clis.md](provider-clis.md) |
| 3 | Clone and create the Python environment | below |
| 4 | The private memory vault | [../getting-started.md](../getting-started.md#3-create-the-private-memory-vault) |
| 5 | Install the local private-memory leak guard | below |
| 6 | Check and launch | below |
| 7 | Optional: the launchd routines | [daemon.md](daemon.md) |
| 8 | Optional: utility MCPs | below |
| 9 | Optional: guarded security MCPs | [security-mcps.md](security-mcps.md) |

Steps 1–6 are required and that is the whole of it — a clone, an environment, a
vault, a local leak guard, and a launch. Steps 7–9 are optional, and skipping them must leave
everything else working — see [What "optional" means](#what-optional-means).

## 1. Core tools

```bash
brew install jq tmux fswatch uv
```

`curl` ships with macOS. Python 3.13 is covered in step 3, which runs `uv sync` --
`uv` itself is installed above because that step depends on it.

Check:

```bash
for t in tmux fswatch jq curl; do command -v "$t" || echo "MISSING: $t"; done
```

## 2. Provider CLIs

`bin/squad up` exits 1 if any of `claude`, `codex`, `agy` (the `gemini` lane),
`grok`, or `kimi` is absent. These are five different installers; see
[provider-clis.md](provider-clis.md) for each one and its authentication step.

## 3. Clone and build the Python environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mtarcure/claude-vibe-squad.git
cd claude-vibe-squad
uv sync
```

`uv sync` creates `.venv`, which the chrono MCP servers and several repository
checks run from. The project pins Python 3.13 (`.python-version`); `uv` will
fetch that interpreter if the host has a different one, which needs network
access on first run.

Check:

```bash
.venv/bin/python --version   # expect Python 3.13.x
```

## 4. Private memory vault

Memory lives outside this repository. See
[Getting started §3](../getting-started.md#3-create-the-private-memory-vault).

## 5. Install the local leak guard

Install a reviewed snapshot of the self-contained private-memory leak guard in
Git's private hooks directory:

```bash
bash docs/install/install-pre-commit-hook.sh
```

The installer refuses to replace an unrelated existing pre-commit hook. It
also removes the retired local `core.hooksPath=.githooks` setting, because that
setting lets the checked-out branch replace the code executed by a later
commit. If a global or system value still overrides Git's private hooks
directory, the installer fails and reports its origin instead of claiming the
guard is active. Remove that setting from the reported scope and rerun the
installer after pulling an intentional leak-guard update.

Check:

```bash
test -x "$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir)/hooks/pre-commit"
bash bin/doctor.sh --check-pre-commit-hook   # expect an OK line and exit 0
git config --show-origin --get-all core.hooksPath  # expect no output and exit 1
git hook run pre-commit                            # expect no output and exit 0 on a clean index
```

The local hook blocks private-memory artifacts. The broader specialist,
capability, and format checks run in CI, where a contributor branch cannot
replace a developer's local executable hook.

## 6. Check and launch

```bash
bin/squad doctor
bin/squad up
```

`doctor` reports what is actually available on this machine. Read its
"could not determine" section: those are **not** passes.

With no launchd routines installed — the state you are in right now — `bin/squad
up` prints one notice naming what the absent daemon would have added, and
continues. Everything below this line is an addition to a working install, not a
prerequisite for one.

## 7. The launchd routines (optional)

`com.vibesquad.daemon` adds the live `● daemon` and per-lane segments in the
tmux status bar, and the documented `POST /mcp/<server>/<tool>` HTTP bridge.
Without it the status bar reads `● daemon offline` and that `curl` path is
unavailable; dispatch, review, memory, and the coordinator never call it.

```bash
bash bin/install-routines.sh --daemon-only   # just the daemon
bash bin/install-routines.sh                 # daemon + the optional routines
```

Full detail, including what the installer refuses to do and why, is in
[daemon.md](daemon.md).

Check:

```bash
bash bin/install-routines.sh --status
```

## 8. Utility MCPs (optional)

Memory, research, and media integrations. These are not model transports —
model inference always runs through the native CLIs.

```bash
bash scripts/bootstrap-mcps.sh --dry-run   # show what would change
bash scripts/bootstrap-mcps.sh             # register them
```

Check:

```bash
bash scripts/bootstrap-mcps.sh --status
```

## 9. Guarded security MCPs (optional)

`guarded-semgrep`, `guarded-slither`, and `guarded-solodit` run behind the Trail
of Bits context-protector wrapper, which is a large third-party checkout that
this repository deliberately does not vendor. See
[security-mcps.md](security-mcps.md).

## What "optional" means

An optional dependency that is absent must disable exactly the thing it
provides, announce that it is missing, and leave everything else working. A
check that reports healthy because it could not measure anything is a defect,
not a pass.

Concretely:

- No `secrets.zsh` → the optional research/media integrations stay off. Nothing
  else changes.
- No `mcp-context-protector` → those three guarded security MCPs are
  unavailable and say so. No other MCP, specialist, or lane is affected.
- A provider CLI that is not installed → `scripts/bootstrap-mcps.sh --status`
  reports its registration state as `UNKNOWN (not measured)`, rather than
  listing every server as missing and implying a measurement it never took.
- No `com.vibesquad.daemon` → `bin/squad up` says so once at launch, the status
  bar reads `● daemon offline` rather than going blank, and the documented HTTP
  tool bridge is unavailable. Dispatch, review, memory, and the coordinator are
  unaffected. An *installed but broken* daemon is a different case and still
  blocks the launch — see [daemon.md](daemon.md).

The five provider CLIs are **not** optional: `bin/squad up` blocks on them.
Neither are `tmux`, `fswatch`, `jq`, `curl`, Python 3.13, and `uv`. Those are
third-party tools doing real work, and requiring them is the point; a background
launchd job of our own is not in that category, which is why it stopped being a
precondition.
