# Getting started

Vibe Squad is currently macOS-first, and setup is manual. The normal experience
is one conversation with Chrono; Codex, Claude, the agy-backed Gemini lane,
Grok, and Kimi run as fresh native CLI processes behind the board.

This page is the narrated walkthrough. For the step-by-step install path with a
check after every step, see [docs/install](install/README.md).

## 1. Install the prerequisites

You need:

- `tmux`, `fswatch`, `jq`, and `curl`
- Python 3.13 and `uv`
- the `claude`, `codex`, `agy`, `grok`, and `kimi` CLIs

```bash
brew install jq tmux fswatch uv
```

All five provider CLIs are required — `bin/squad up` exits 1 if any is missing.
Three have a one-line install:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash   # claude
npm install -g @openai/codex                     # codex
uv tool install kimi-cli                          # kimi
```

These run vendor code as your user. Pin a version where the registry allows it
(`npm install -g @openai/codex@<version>`, `uv tool install 'kimi-cli==<version>'`) and read an
installer script before piping it to a shell.

The other two have no package-manager install and must be obtained from their
vendors:

- `agy` is Antigravity's CLI, distributed by Google as a standalone binary
  (Antigravity: <https://antigravity.google>). There is no Homebrew, npm, or `uv`
  package — download the binary and put it on your `PATH`.
- `grok` is xAI's Grok CLI. There is no Homebrew, npm, or `uv` package and no
  confirmed one-line public install command — obtain the binary from xAI's
  official distribution and put it on your `PATH`. A working install links `grok`
  from under `~/.grok`, so that directory (or wherever you place the binary) must
  be on your `PATH`. This repository carries no verified download URL for it; the
  per-CLI acquisition and auth detail is in
  [Provider CLIs](install/provider-clis.md).

Both are mandatory: because `bin/squad up` refuses to launch until all five CLIs
resolve, there is no partial-lane path past the dependency gate. Per-CLI
installation and authentication detail is in
[Provider CLIs](install/provider-clis.md).

Claude, Codex, Gemini-through-agy, and Kimi authenticate through their supported
subscription, OAuth, or managed-login paths. The Grok board lane is the exception:
it requires an xAI API key (`model-lanes/lane-capabilities.tsv` declares
`xai-api-key-only`). `GEMINI_API_KEY` is not Gemini lane authentication. Model
inference always runs through those native CLIs, never through an MCP server.

Per-CLI authentication steps, postcondition checks, and the `PATH` gotcha for
`claude` and `kimi` are in [Provider CLIs](install/provider-clis.md).

Check the core tools before moving on. The full required-command set, including
the five CLIs, is verified against the repo's authoritative list right after you
clone in step 2 — that check needs the repository, so it cannot run here yet:

```bash
for t in tmux fswatch jq curl uv; do command -v "$t" >/dev/null 2>&1 || echo "MISSING: $t"; done
```

## 2. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mtarcure/claude-vibe-squad.git
cd claude-vibe-squad
uv sync
```

`uv sync` creates the local Python environment used by optional utility
integrations and repository checks.

Now that the repository is present, verify the full required-command set against
its authoritative list, run from the repo root:

```bash
source shared/launch-dependencies.sh
for dep in "${SQUAD_REQUIRED_COMMANDS[@]}"; do
  command -v "$dep" >/dev/null 2>&1 || echo "MISSING: $dep"
done
```

## 3. Create the private memory vault

Memory must live outside this public repository. Choose one stable, absolute
path and keep it across sessions:

```bash
export CHRONO_VAULT_ROOT="$HOME/Obsidian-Chrono"
mkdir -p "$CHRONO_VAULT_ROOT"
chmod 700 "$CHRONO_VAULT_ROOT"
if [ ! -f "$CHRONO_VAULT_ROOT/.chrono-vault" ]; then
  printf '%s\n' '{"vault_id":"local-vibesquad","schema_version":1}' \
    > "$CHRONO_VAULT_ROOT/.chrono-vault"
  chmod 600 "$CHRONO_VAULT_ROOT/.chrono-vault"
fi
```

Persist `CHRONO_VAULT_ROOT` in your shell configuration. Do not place this
directory inside the clone, and never commit its notes or credentials. See the
[Chrono Vault guide](../plugins/chrono-vault/README.md) for its data model and
safety boundary.

## 4. Configure authentication and optional tools

If you enable the optional Gemini-backed media provider, make its
`GEMINI_API_KEY` available through your local secret store or shell environment.
The agy lane itself uses OAuth and does not consume that key. Do not add it, or
any other credential, to the repository.

Utility MCPs provide memory, research, browser, and media tools; they are not
model transports. Review what the bootstrap would change before registering
them in your user-level CLI configuration:

```bash
bash scripts/bootstrap-mcps.sh --dry-run
bash scripts/bootstrap-mcps.sh
```

The second command is optional. Run it only when you want those integrations.
An absent optional provider disables exactly what it provides and leaves
everything else working; `--status` reports an uninstalled CLI's registration
state as `UNKNOWN (not measured)` rather than guessing.

`guarded-semgrep`, `guarded-slither`, and `guarded-solodit` additionally need the
Trail of Bits context-protector wrapper, which is an install-time dependency this
repository never vendors. Without it those three servers are unavailable and say
so. See [Guarded security MCPs](install/security-mcps.md).

## 5. Check and launch

Install the private-memory leak guard first. `bin/squad doctor` checks for it,
and `bin/squad up` will not launch on a failed `doctor`, so this step comes
before the check:

```bash
bash docs/install/install-pre-commit-hook.sh
```

Then check and launch:

```bash
bin/squad doctor
bin/squad up
```

That is the end of the required path. Nothing has to be installed into `launchd`
first: with no daemon present, `bin/squad up` prints one notice saying so and
carries on.

`doctor` reports what is actually available on this machine; installed files or
configuration alone are not proof that a capability works. Resolve any reported
errors before relying on the affected capability.

`doctor` has two modes. The default is the fast pre-flight, and it is what
`bin/squad up` gates on under `SQUAD_DOCTOR_TIMEOUT` (45 seconds). A handful of
checks — currently the public-export hygiene gate, which takes minutes on a
large working tree — cost more than that budget, so the fast run declines them
and lists them under **NOT MEASURED IN FAST MODE**. Those are not passes; run
`bin/squad doctor --deep` to measure them. The nightly routine already does.

## 6. Optional: the launchd routines

`launchd/` holds templates, not installable plists, and none of them is a
precondition for running the squad.

```bash
bash bin/install-routines.sh --daemon-only   # just com.vibesquad.daemon
bash bin/install-routines.sh                 # daemon + the optional routines (docs/install/daemon.md)
bash bin/install-routines.sh --status
```

**Before installing, know what these agents run.** Each plist is rendered to
execute code from your checkout on every launch, with no immutable snapshot — so
checking out a branch you have not reviewed, a fork's pull request above all, in a
clone where they are loaded runs that branch's code as your user.
`com.vibesquad.daemon` and `com.claudevibesquad.nightly` first source your entire
`$HOME/.config/shell/secrets.zsh`, and `com.vibesquad.chrome` owns your
authenticated Chrome (CDP on `127.0.0.1:9222`, no auth), so that execution carries
your credentials and logged-in sessions, not just your file access.
`com.chrono.squad-monitor` re-runs its checkout script **every 120 seconds**, so
the realistic window is about two minutes, not a restart or an overnight wait. The
installer manages three agents, but `com.chrono.squad-monitor` and
`com.vibesquad.chrome` are installed by no repository command and never appear in
`--status`. Unload whichever agents you have loaded before the checkout, then
reload afterwards — this leaves the plist in place, it is not an uninstall:

```bash
launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/<label>                                       # unload
launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) "$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/<label>.plist"  # reload
```

The [daemon guide](install/daemon.md#security-every-listed-agent-runs-code-from-your-checkout)
is the canonical list of every label, its cadence, and which the installer can
manage versus which you must handle by hand. A fix separating the installed code
root from the live data root is planned.

What `com.vibesquad.daemon` adds, and nothing else does:

- the live `● daemon` indicator and the per-lane task capsules in the tmux
  status bar — its `/tasks` endpoint is where `bin/vs-lane-status.sh` reads them
- the `POST /mcp/<server>/<tool>` HTTP bridge documented in
  `plugins/chrono-recon/README.md`

What runs identically without it: board dispatch and worktree isolation, the
outbox watcher, the reconciliation sweep, the Chrono coordinator, `bin/squad
doctor`, and private memory. None of them opens a connection to it.

What visibly degrades without it: the status bar reads `● daemon offline`
instead of live lane state, and the documented `curl` bridge to the MCP servers
is unavailable. Both are stated at launch, not discovered later.

The installer renders both `__VAULT_ROOT__` and `__HOME__`, refuses a plist with
any unresolved token, validates it with `plutil`, installs it atomically, and
verifies the load with `launchctl print` instead of trusting an exit code. It
will not overwrite a plist you have edited without `--force`, and it will not
bootstrap over a label already loaded from a different file.

Once a daemon *is* installed, `bin/squad up` becomes strict about it again: a
broken or foreign one stops the launch rather than running around it. Absent is
fine; broken is not.

See [The launchd daemon](install/daemon.md) for the failure modes and uninstall.

`--safe` does not select a more conservative profile — no such profile exists.
It suppresses the first-run autonomy warning and skips the pre-flight `doctor`
gate, so plain `bin/squad up` is the stricter of the two on a fresh install.
Permissions for the coordinator and for board-dispatched workers are identical
either way. Ask Chrono for work in plain language, then explicitly choose
Project for delivery work or Bounty for authorized security work when a typed
workflow is needed.

Useful lifecycle commands:

```bash
bin/squad status
bin/squad attach
bin/squad stop
```
