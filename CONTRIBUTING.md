# Contributing

Vibe Squad is intentionally small and markdown-first. Contributions should make a single-operator local squad easier to run, safer to leave unattended, or clearer to audit.

## Architecture Rules

- Chrono is the only controller.
- GPT/Codex, Claude, Gemini, Kimi, and Grok are model leads, not department owners.
- `shared/specialist-runtime-map.tsv` is the routing source of truth.
- `departments/` is source namespace and mailbox compatibility storage only.
- Modes, specialist briefs, model lead prompts, and protocol rules stay in markdown.
- Scripts are launch, dispatch, watcher, validator, and routine rails.

## Adding Workflows

- Add cross-cutting specialists under `shared/specialists/`.
- Add namespace-specific specialist markdown under `departments/<source_namespace>/specialists/`.
- Add the specialist to `shared/specialist-runtime-map.tsv` with `primary_lane`, `review_lane`, `source_namespace`, tools, safety level, and notes.
- Add or update mode workflows in `shared/modes/` only when the operator-facing workflow changes.
- Keep prompts short and non-conflicting; avoid duplicating the same role contract in several files.

## Safety

No patch should introduce silent live sends, silent deletes, credential changes, private-memory export, or public-release changes without operator approval. High-risk work needs multi-model review with the reviewer read-only unless Chrono serializes a later write pass.

## Development Checks

**First, in every fresh clone, install the reviewed pre-commit guard outside the worktree:**

```bash
bash docs/install/install-pre-commit-hook.sh
```

The installer copies the self-contained private-memory leak guard into Git's private
`.git/hooks/` directory. Never point `core.hooksPath` at `.githooks` or symlink a hook back into
the worktree: a checked-out branch could then replace code that runs as you on the next commit.
The local guard blocks private-memory leaks; the broader specialist, format, capability, and moat
checks run in CI. Re-run the installer after pulling an intentional guard update. Details and
verification commands are in [docs/git-hooks.md](docs/git-hooks.md).

Run the relevant checks before opening a PR. These work in any clone, including the public one:

```bash
for script in $(git ls-files '*.sh'); do
  bash -n "$script" || exit 1
done
python3 -m py_compile scripts/python/*.py bin/*.py
bash bin/validate-specialists.sh
bash bin/doctor.sh
```

In a public clone, `validate-specialists.sh` prints non-fatal `registry-not-published` warnings: the private skill-tool registry is deliberately withheld from the public tree, so registry-backed cross-checks run only on the maintainer checkout. A warning there is expected; a non-zero exit is a real failure in either tree.

Maintainer-only (reads the private identifier denylist, which the public tree does not carry — it exits early in a public clone):

```bash
bash bin/product-hygiene.sh --public-export
```

The public repo's CI (`.github/workflows/public-validate.yml`) validates what the public tree actually carries on every push and PR.

For dispatch changes, smoke test at least one cross-namespace route where `source_namespace` and `to_model` differ.

## Style

- Bash: `set -uo pipefail`, `mkdir -p` before writes, atomic writes for state files.
- Python: keep scripts under `scripts/python/`; use type hints where they clarify behavior.
- Markdown: YAML frontmatter for specialists, modes, and profiles; concise instructions; no stale release-plan prose in canonical prompts.
